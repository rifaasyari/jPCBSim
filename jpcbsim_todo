High Priority
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--allow changing of the pcb dielectric thickness and re-import the model (re-write the .m file)
--come up with model to fit data from "Reconstruction of the Parameters of Debye and Lorentzian Dispersive Media using a Genetic Algorith"  
  Zhang, Koledintseva, et.al.
-add N-port simulation outputs >2 ports to s-param and smith chart plots
-Don't allow selection of projects while a simulation is running
-add ability to specify port resistance via 'value' of TPN component in eagle
find several examples and optimize parameters for distributing.
documentation
update wiki page with current documentation and new examples and hints for eagle (zero line width, spacing, etc)
plot time-domain data
copy eagle brd, sch, and hyp files to project dir when doing import
eagle cad binary / button
get dispersive materials working again  (Lorentz-Debye model)

Lower priority
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
add volumetric mesh deform view for electric field during simulation  (file dump would be too large in most cases)
add button for qucs ??
**lumped elements from eagle output
**figure out what to do with microstrip vs co-planar excitation
add re-import pop-up to projects
about dialog
figure out why model is inverted on axis for antenna and others?
plots of excitation pulse?
qucs export (or disable for now)
"reset to defaults" buttons
kappa calculator
add ability to save/display notes for a given simulation
antenna patterns??
ability to load openEMS xml file format.
add option for plot update on port_* file change.
add button for paraview viewing of E-field plots
add button for linsmith ??
3D Excitation / Sensor port editor
view animated E-field (simulation time)
pdf reports
virtual TDR mode  (single reflection runtime)
